The People Generator API is a Java-based API built using **Spring Boot**. It generates fake user data for testing purposes. The data includes name, address, phone number, email, and more. You can find a live site with more details at: [peoplegeneratorapi.me](http://peoplegeneratorapi.me).

### NOTE: If you request a large amount of people from the /api/person/ endpoint, the data will be in a compressed Gzip format.

If you have any suggestions, issues, or feature requests, please let me know, and I'll do my best to fix them.
